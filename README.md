# trello_back

## for install

$ npm install or yarn 
```

## for run

```
$ nodemon index.js or yarn index.js
```

 for that was more simple for testing i let the .env in the git but in a real project i would not do that, and i give you my db in this folder. Thanks for the opportunity to do this project, i hope you like it.
